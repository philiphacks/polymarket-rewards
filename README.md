# Polymarket - Market Making & Farming

## Main Strategy

The main strategy farms the /rewards page and adds YES & NO bids within the midpoint range at the most conservative spread.

Hedging has to be done manually, e.g. if you get filled on a YES for X shares, you have to calculate the Y share amount for NO to buy (in order to hedge).

Currently makes ~$15/day. Not great, but low effort.
